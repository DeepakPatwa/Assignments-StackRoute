Inheritance and useful Java Classes : Practice Exercise 3
1.     Create a class called StudentMarks, which prompts user for the number of students, reads it from the keyboard, and saves it in an int variable called numOfStudents. It then prompts user for the grades of each of the students and saves them in an int array called stuGrades. Your program shall check that the grade is between 0 and 100 else has to trow an error message.
2.     Write a program to compute the addition of two matrix, Read the number of rows and columns as input, also the values of each matrix
  Output:
  Input number of rows of matrix: 3
  Input number of columns of matrix: 2
  Input elements of first matrix: 1 2 3 4 5 6
  Input the elements of second matrix: 9 8 7 6 5 4
  Sum of the matrices:-
                     10        10      
                     10        10      
                     10        10

3. Write a java program to calculate first and last date of a week.
  Output:

  Last date of the week:          Sun 30/07/2017

4. Write a program to set up an array of places, Loop round and remove the vowels. Display the new words in console
 Input:
    India
    United States
    Germany
     Egypt
     czechoslovakia

Output:
    Place Name without Vowels:0 Ind
    Place Name without Vowels:1 Untd Stts
    Place Name without Vowels:2 Grmny
    Place Name without Vowels:3 Egypt
    Place Name without Vowels:4 czchslvk

5. Write a program to create a ChessBoard pattern with the help of multidimensional array, where WWrepresents white color and BB represents Black color.
 Output:
 My Chess Board
      WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|
      BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|
      WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|
      BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|
      WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|
      BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|
      WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|
      BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|BB|WW|

6. Write a program to find out if a series of 7 digits are consecutive numbers. To make this easier, assume the digits are a string and use split()
 Input: 98,96,95,94,93
 Output: 98,96,95,94,93 non consecutive numbers
  
 Input: 54,53,52,51,50,49,48
 Output : 54,53,52,51,50,49,48 are consecutive numbers
  
 Input: 1,2,3,4,5,6,6
 Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,6 non consecutive numbers

7. Create a class with a main( ) that throws an object of class Exception inside a try block.
 a. Give the constructor for Exception a String argument.
 b. Catch the exception inside a catch clause and print the String argument.
 c. Add a finally clause and print a message to prove you were there.

8. Write a program that will generate exceptions of type NegativeArraySizeException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException. Record the catching of each exception by displaying the message stored in the exception object.

	 Input: This is Harry.
	 Output: Is Harry here ? true
	 Input : This is Henry.
	 Output: Is Harry here ? false

6. Write a program to find out the multiple occurrences of the given word in a string using Matcher methods.
	 Input : She sells seashells by the seashore   
	 Given word: se
